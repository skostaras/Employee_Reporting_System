# Employee Reporting System
A simple REST API application that stores and retrieves employees' reports. 

The application is built with Spring Boot and uses MySQL. First create an "EmployeeReportingSystem" schema (or run the included SQL). Credentials are included in application.properties file.  The tables are autogenerated after the application starts.
Clean, install the project and run it as a Spring Boot App. Import the included Postman Collection and send the requests. 
Open MySQL Workbench or the in-memory H2 console http://localhost:8088/employeeReportsSystem/h2-console/, grab your popcorn 
and watch while the data gets manipulated by the Postman API requests.
